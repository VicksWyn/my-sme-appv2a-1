# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

create for  me a well structured prompt for the update on the SME CROSS-PLATFORM APP DEVELOPMENT PROJECT ABOVE
I like to introduce access control on the dashboard by defining 2 different roles. Under authentication replace the word signin with registration and add an extra form for SME'S unique name,once the sme name is registered for the first time by a user, these user should be assigned a role  boss and a unique ID. Whenever the boss login should be directed to a dashboard with the previledge to access all features, that is,1. User profile(Name of sme, Name of user, Role, user id, Associate(with 2 checkboxes by default with lables Associate.....n( where n in the number of check boxes, checkboxes=2>=n<=5). Once the boss checks a box under associate, should be redirected to registration forms where he will register the details of the associate member as the registration forms requires but an extra placeholder will require boss userID for the associate member to be authenticated to the same sme as the boss). 2 Stock (update button(will redirect to stock recording),View button(will redirect to current unsold items list))3.Sales(duration(select either daily,weekly,monthly,quarterly,semi annually and anually) after you will be redirected to sales list only to items recorded at the selected duration above) 3.Receipt(list(will redirect to receiptHistory) and New(will redirect to receiptNew)) 4. charts( boss will select duration(daily,weekly,monthly, quaterly,semi annualy and annually) and one or multiple items will will triger pie charts to display performance in terms of percentage).
Now for the associate user that is AR1,AR2........once they login will be redirected to dashboard with limited features, which are 1. user profile(name of the sme, name of the user, role = Associate). 2.Stock recording(will prompt a form requesting  entry(by selecting or typing) of item and quantity(only valid numbers) then submit button which will redirect to ->current unsold items list). 3 sales Recording(will open a form requiring selection  of an item, selection of valid quantity and  selection of amountType either in form of cash or mpesa then amount. After that there will be 3 buttons(AddItem(will opem similar form as the one above to enter item2, quantity and amount),submit(will record the details in salesList) and ReceptNew(will download the receipt softcopy(with details which was recorded in the form above + a unique randomNumber for reference purposes) and add the receipt in receipt list)))


I will first share tghe tables in the database as you analyse and compare what should filled in registration form and what should be displayed in the databaselocalStorage.clear();
